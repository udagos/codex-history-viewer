# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Added file-level **AI Change History** for workspace files, available from the opt-in **File Change History > Explorer Context Menu: Enabled** setting, with source toggles, in-view search, paging, source-aware card navigation, and links back to the matching diff card in the original session view.
- Added history-view performance modes for large histories, including a simplified mode that loads heavy diff/detail sections on demand.
- Added the `latest` option to `codexHistoryViewer.chat.openPosition` so chat sessions can open at the latest rendered card.
- Added optional compact date guides for history and file-change views that can be enabled or disabled from settings.
- Added settings:
  - `codexHistoryViewer.fileChangeHistory.explorerContextMenu.enabled`
  - `codexHistoryViewer.chat.performanceMode`
  - `codexHistoryViewer.ui.timeGuide.enabled`

### Changed

- Custom title actions now use a shared QuickPick flow from tree context menus and the chat viewer header.
- Codex `apply_patch` activity is now shown as diff cards when possible, while duplicate cards are avoided when matching `patch_apply_end` events are also present.
- Codex diff cards now aggregate repeated updates to the same file within a single turn.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Changed chat auto-refresh `follow latest` scrolling to prefer the latest non-diff content card when trailing grouped diff cards are last. The bottom scroll action targets the latest rendered card.
- Changed search indexing for Codex `custom_tool_call` records so `toolCalls` and `toolCallsAndOutputs` include lightweight tool metadata such as actions, commands, files, and paths.

### Fixed

- Fixed chat auto-refresh `follow latest` scrolling sometimes being overridden by pending card-anchor restoration or later layout updates.
- Fixed `lastMessage` chat open-position saving and restoring when no message bubble is visible, falling back to the previous rendered message or the top.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added extension-local custom titles for Codex and Claude sessions.
- Added session tree tooltip modes (`full`, `compact`, `titleOnly`) so users can choose between detailed metadata and a one-line title-only tooltip.
- Added `codexHistoryViewer.search.indexToolContent` to control whether the search index stores conversation text only, tool calls, or tool calls plus tool outputs.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added `SECURITY.md` with the current security policy and guidance for the `markdown-it` GHSA-38c4-r59v-3vqw / CVE-2026-2327 advisory.
- Added localized initial-loading rows to the History and Pinned views while the first history refresh is still running.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Added collapsible assistant usage rows in the chat viewer when **Show details** is enabled.
- Added helpful History empty-state rows for no-history and no-filter-match states.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added a chat tab auto-refresh button in the chat header, shown when the History auto-refresh setting is enabled.
- Added per-tab auto-refresh modes: off, preserve current view, and follow latest.
- Added automatic refresh for open chat tabs while VS Code is focused, including background editor tabs. Only affected tabs are refreshed, and new or different sessions start with auto-refresh off.
- Added on-demand loading for chat image data so large image attachments no longer need to be sent to the Webview during the initial session render.
- Added card-based scroll restoration when toggling chat details on or off, including fallback to the next visible card when the previous card is hidden in summary mode.

### Changed

- Deferred heavy tool arguments, tool output, and patch diff rows until details are shown or a diff entry is expanded.

### Fixed

- Preserved chat tab UI state across reload and auto-refresh, including expanded cards/diffs, details visibility, diff wrap state, selected message, in-page search state, and scroll behavior.
- Reset session-scoped Webview UI state when a reusable chat tab switches to a different session, including in-page search state, image preview state, and image data cache.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Added a History view mode switch between date-grouped history and a latest-first flat session list.
- Added opt-in automatic history refresh for local session file changes, with debounce delay and refresh interval settings.
- Automatic refresh is deferred while the History view is hidden or the VS Code window is not focused.
- Added image attachment rendering in the chat viewer for supported Codex / Claude image data and local image references.
- Added an option to open chat sessions from the top or restore near the last viewed message.

### Changed

- Changed chat tab handling so session selection uses a reusable tab, while **Open in New Tab (Chat)** keeps sessions in dedicated tabs and reuses existing matching tabs.
- Changed the chat viewer scroll area so the fixed toolbar stays outside the scrollable content.
- Changed the settings display order.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Added opt-in diagnostic timing logs for history refresh and search-index maintenance.

### Changed

- Capped the in-memory Undo stack at 20 recent actions to avoid unbounded memory growth.
- Changed history refresh to process session files with bounded parallelism for better first-load and cache-miss performance.
- Changed history lookup to use a `Map`-backed index instead of scanning all sessions.
- Changed timestamp handling to use the VS Code extension host time zone.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale chat panels for deleted or missing session files by checking file existence before opening/reloading and closing missing panels on refresh/delete.
- Fixed delete Undo cleanup so temporary backup files are removed when Undo actions are discarded, cleared, or completed.
- Made search-index stale-entry cleanup explicit.
- Localized Undo notification labels and action names.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Added per-card full-width expansion controls in the chat viewer for messages, tool cards, notes, and grouped diffs.
- Added previous/next navigation controls to grouped diff cards.

### Changed

- Clarified localization ownership by keeping VS Code manifest strings in `package.nls.*` and runtime/Webview strings in `l10n/bundle.l10n.*`.

- Added native title resolution for Codex sessions from `session_index.jsonl`, plus a lightweight cache to preserve known titles for older sessions.

### Changed

- Session list labels and chat panel titles can now use native titles when `history.titleSource` is set to `nativeWhenAvailable`.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Added grouped patch-based change cards in the chat viewer by parsing `patch_apply_end` events from session logs.
- Added collapsible side-by-side before/after diffs for patch entries, with per-hunk wrap toggles and jump-to-line actions.
- Added a right-side in-page search sidebar for the chat viewer with keyboard shortcuts, match counts, result snippets, and direct result navigation.

### Changed

- Changed patch cards so they are shown even when **Show details** is off, while each file entry remains collapsed by default.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added tool-specific cards in the chat viewer, with a new `codexHistoryViewer.chat.toolDisplayMode` setting (`detailsOnly` / `compactCards`).

  - `codexHistoryViewer.chat.userLongMessageFolding`
  - `codexHistoryViewer.chat.assistantLongMessageFolding`
- Added chat toolbar quick scroll buttons to jump to the top or bottom of the session.

### Changed

- Chat tool rows are now left-aligned and use card-style presentation with icons, accents, and status emphasis.
- Chat viewer reload now preserves scroll/selection and refreshes the tab title using the active history date basis.
- Chat toolbar now automatically switches label buttons to icon-only mode when the header width becomes narrow.
- Code block copy buttons in the chat viewer now use icon-only actions instead of text labels.

### Fixed

- Added support for workspace-relative Markdown file links in both Claude and Codex session views.
- Added transcript-side local link resolution so relative Markdown file links open the source file inside VS Code.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Added `codexHistoryViewer.history.dateBasis` to switch the History tree and date-based search filters between session start date and last message date.
- Added tooltip date details so sessions can show both `Started` and `Last activity` when they differ.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Added syntax-highlighted fenced code blocks in the chat-like viewer (powered by Shiki).
